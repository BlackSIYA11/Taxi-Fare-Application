The Taxi Fare Application is a simple web-based tool designed to calculate the total fare for a taxi ride based on the number of people in each row and the rate per person. The app supports multiple rows (5 rows in total) where users can input the number of people and the amount they entered. The app then calculates the total fare for each row and provides the change based on the amount entered.
